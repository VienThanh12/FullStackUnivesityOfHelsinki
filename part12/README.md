# A container

# Problem:

When you build a website, you need many packages or dependencies to run the app but when you switch to another machine, you have to download all of these things again.
So docker will solve this problem.

# Solution:

Pack everything in a container. It doesn’t need to know what is inside the box but you just need to run it to use the application. By running a virtual machine

# Type of Docker:

Docker-file: Describes what you need in your projects
Docker-images: Docker hub

# Kubernetes

Kubernetes → organize all of the docker containers (have too many containers)
